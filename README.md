## Responsible for
UI and sound effects

## Compiling
Windows is our build target. Only x86 builds will work Please compile using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019. No special setup should be required beyond this.

## Controls
Default controls are as follows:

Forward: Up Arrow or W
Back: Down Arrow or S
Turn Left: Left Arrow or A
Turn Right: Right Arrow or D
Controls may be re-bound using the configuration file, located after first run of the game, here: C:\Users*Username*\AppData\Roaming\BigOnion
Files placed here are saved/loaded by the game, regardless of where core data files exist.

## Known Issues
UI Volume controls do not interact with volume settings in configuration file. Both function independently.
Memory leak when starting a new map.

## Team Leader
Github repository is publicly accessible, here: https://github.com/JasonHutton/BigOnion.git The master branch should be used to build from.
